# CNN-CIFAR-10-Image-Classification
Using a convolutional neural network to work on the CIFAR 10 dataset

Here is the daataset https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
(but I will probably load it in from Tensorflow directly)


The Jupyter notebook is what I ran on Kaggle in order to use their GPU (trying to run optuna on my own machine took forever).
Using optuna, ended up with these scores
sparse_categorical_crossentropy: 0.5892660617828369
sparse_categorical_accuracy: 0.8147000074386597
